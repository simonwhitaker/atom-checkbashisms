# checkbashisms package

Runs the `checkbashisms` script as a linter on shell scripts.

You'll need a copy of `checkbashisms` installed; this package assumes it's at `/usr/local/bin/checkbashisms` but you can change that in Atom's settings.

## Getting the checkbashisms script

On Debian-style Linuxes:

    apt-get devscripts

On Mac OS X:

    brew install checkbashisms
